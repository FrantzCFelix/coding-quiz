# coding-quiz

An application that quiz's the user on pre-defined JavaScript questions and logs a high score after they are done.

## Description

User will be prompted with starting the quiz. This will start the timer which is the number of questions x 15 seconds, Then a question and choices will pop up. The quiz will tell the user if their choice is right/wrong. If it is wrong it will take away 10 seconds from the time. Once the user is out of questions/ out of time. The user will then be prompted to put their initials. They will then be brought to a highscore screen, where they can either go back to the start screen or clear the highscores. Past highscores will also be displayed here from local storage unless it is cleared.

## Getting Started

Just go to https://frantzcfelix.github.io/coding-quiz/ and the user will be prompted to start the quiz immediately.


### Executing program

* Go to a web browser(use chrome please).
* Type in https://frantzcfelix.github.io/coding-quiz/
* Hit start.
* Select an answer to the question.
* Once quiz is finished enter initals.
* Then clear highscore board screen or go back to start screen to start over again.

## Help
Some issues my code currently has:
* Spamming answers will cause multiple right or wrong bubbles to pop up
* A blank highscore will show up in the first spot on the highscore page.
* Need to break up my JS into a file per page. I had to add a work around to get my one script to work on the teo different html pages.
